      label: To prevent spam reports, we need to know whether you are viewing within the UK. The majority of channels are restricted to viewers outside of the UK, and they may be restricted to viewers using a Virtual Private Network. We also ask you to check that a stream works within VLC, since it may be an issue with your application.

        - label: I'm watching within the UK, and I'm not using a VPN
