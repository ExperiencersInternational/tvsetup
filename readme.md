# TV Setup

This programming guide is only useful for the UK West Midlands/South West regions, particularly Gloucestershire. Some channels may not play due to being geo-blocked. Planning to use personally when switching to an Android TV.

This guide is based off the Freeview guide, but may include radio stations as well.

Go to experiencersinternational.github.io/tvsetup/config.m3u to get started.
