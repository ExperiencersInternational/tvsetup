# TV Setup

UK IPTV programming guide. All channels currently should work, but depending on your viewer, the last channel may not work, and BBC One West Midlands may not work due to geo-restrictions.

This guide is based off the Freeview guide, but may include radio stations and extra channels not found on Freeview as well. EPG currently won't work on this by the way, I have no idea how to fix this at the moment.

Edit: If you're using TVirl on a Android TV device, you should be able to add the EPG from IPTV-org and everything should work except radio (link https://iptv-org.github.io/epg/guides/UK.xml).

Enter experiencersinternational.github.io/tvsetup/config.m3u in your IPTV app to start receiving TV through the internet. You may also have to add the EPG URL listed above.
