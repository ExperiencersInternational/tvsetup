# TV Setup

UK IPTV programming guide. All channels currently should work, but depending on your viewer, the last channel may not work, and BBC One West Midlands may not work due to geo-restrictions.

This guide is based off the Freeview guide, but may include radio stations as well. EPG currently won't work on this by the way.

Go to experiencersinternational.github.io/tvsetup/config.m3u to get started.
