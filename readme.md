# TVsetup

## About

A list of free-to-air, mostly available on Freeview, channels in the UK. Contains over 140 channels (currently about 110 due to withdrawing some broken channels) from TV to Radio.

Get started by adding the playlist link in your application:

```
https://experiencersinternational.github.io/tvsetup/config.m3u
```

If your application doesn't automatically add an EPG, add this 48-hour EPG run by @dp247:

```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dp247/Freeview-EPG/master/epg.xml
```

Most channels are ordered in the Freeview style, so you'll feel right at home. A few exceptions do apply though.

For update information, follow me over on the fediverse `@experiencersinternational@mstdn.social`.

If you want to contribute, read the [contributing guide](docs/contributing_guide.md) first.

### Copyright 

Despite it being my best intentions not to host any copyrighted content, due to only focusing on free to air content, there may be a few things that slip through the cracks, and in those cases, please submit a copyright removal request to me, and I will remove the affected content on the list. Please don't just go and file a request to GitHub and take down the entire thing.

Please also note that I don't host any of the content apart from the Information channel which is a looping video.

## Compatibility

**I need to rewrite this all eventually, I'll probably be putting some guides on the wiki out for compatibility eventually.**

This service is fully based around the TVirl app for Android TV, it works with all of the features in here perfectly.
You should steer away from the IPTV smarters pro app for mobile (in fact, plain old VLC is probably better), EPG doesn't work as far as I can see with no subscription, channels don't scan properly and some don't play properly.

In order to get correct channel ordering, make sure tvg-chno is used for channel ordering.

## Channels

Not bothering to write down everything, but this allows easy access to most popular channels. Most TV channels broadcast in 25fps apart from Ideal World.

**EDIT: Some of these channels may have been removed, and I haven't gone and removed them from the list below. STV has replaced ITV1, same with the +1 stream.**
