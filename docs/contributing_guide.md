Here is a few basic things to take note of when contributing:
- **DO NOT** add any pay to view channels (e.g. Sky Max), else this risks me getting a cease and desist since I'm not operating free to air channels only
- Please order it as close to the Freeview guide as possible, if the free to air channel is not usually in the Freeview guide, place it in a free space in the 800s range
- Please only add channels in the highest quality you can find
- For local TV channels excluding radio, please list in the 92x to 99x ranges
- For local radio stations, use Freeview numbers. If multiple channels use the same numbers, use a - to separate the regions (e.g. 735-1 for Radio Gloucestershire and 735-2 for Radio Derby). If a radio station is not broadcast on Freeview, stick to 740-798 in range
- For channels intended for Wales, stick to a listing in the 90x range, and for channels intended for Scotland, use a channel number in the 91x range
- When adding a channel, if you can, try and mention the quality of the channel that you are adding
