# Contributing guide

## What we need

If you want to add stuff, here's what we need and how you can help out:

* Additional radio stations EPG (contribute at https://github.com/dp247/Freeview-EPG)
* Readable channel icons (icons must be in white only)

## Rules

### Channel ordering

I hope this is as clear as I can make it. If you find that someone has already added the channel you want to add, but it's a different link, **ALWAYS** position from 850-899.

#### Radio / Audio-only content

* If the channel is broadcast on Freeview, follow the positioning Freeview uses
* If it's not broadcast on Freeview, put the channel in the range from 740-798

#### Local channels

Unless the Freeview channel number that the channel has been assigned (if it's available on Freeview that is) is only used in the specific region the channel broadcasts in (e.g. TV Warehouse and TG4), follow these steps:

* For channels intended for Wales, position in the 900-909 range
* For channels intended for Scotland, position in the 910-919 range
* For all other regions, position in the 920-949 or 970-999 range

#### All other content

If it's available on Freeview, put it where it would usually go. If it's not, you can occupy the 800-849 range.

### Other rules

Here is a few basic things to take note of when contributing:
- **DO NOT** add any pay to view channels (e.g. Sky Max), else this risks me getting a cease and desist since I'm not operating free to air channels only
- Please only add channels in the highest quality you can find
- When adding a channel, if you can, try and mention the quality of the channel that you are adding
- Pornographic content is accepted, but you must also add clear warnings like Freeview does (blank ADULT section channel) to note that the channel hosts adult content. I cannot review streams due to myself being a minor.
